# Dynamic Memory Allocator
Designed a dynamic memory allocator written in C. The goal was to implement custom functions from the C standard library including malloc, free, realloc, and memalign. My contributions include all of the functions in the sfmm.c file which follows the structure described in sfmm.h.
